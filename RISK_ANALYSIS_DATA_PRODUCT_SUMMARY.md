### Data Sources and Events

**Input Events**:
- `funny-bunny.xyz.fraud-detection.v1.transaction.scorecard.created`
- `funny-bunny.xyz.risk-management.v1.risk.decision.approved`
- `funny-bunny.xyz.risk-management.v1.risk.decision.rejected`

**Event Format**: CloudEvents with JSON payload over Apache Kafka

## Data Product Design Decisions

### 1. Schema Architecture

**Dimensional Model**: Optimized for OLAP queries
- **Dimensions (14 fields)**: Risk levels, transaction identifiers, participant info, payment details
- **Metrics (11 fields)**: Fraud scores, risk calculations, financial amounts
- **Time Fields (4 fields)**: Analysis timestamps, order timestamps, partitioning fields

**Key Design Principles**:
- Flattened structure for optimal query performance
- Comprehensive scoring metrics for detailed analysis
- Time-based partitioning for efficient data management
- Primary key design for data integrity

### 2. Indexing Strategy

**Inverted Indexes**: Fast filtering on categorical dimensions
- Risk decision status, risk levels, seller IDs, currencies, payment status

**Range Indexes**: Efficient range queries on numerical/temporal data
- Risk scores, payment amounts, timestamps, analysis hours

**Bloom Filters**: Optimized point lookups for unique identifiers
- Transaction IDs, order IDs, payment IDs, card tokens

### 3. Real-time Processing Configuration

**Table Type**: `REALTIME` for sub-second latency
**Segment Management**: 
- 6-hour flush intervals or 100MB segments
- Balanced assignment strategy for load distribution
- 2x replication for high availability

**Stream Processing**:
- Kafka low-level consumer for optimal throughput
- JSON message decoder for CloudEvents
- Automatic offset management with earliest reset

### 4. Data Transformation Pipeline

**Complex JSON Extractions**: 
- Nested transaction data flattening
- Score calculations with business logic
- Timestamp normalization and formatting

**Business Logic Implementation**:
- Risk score weighting (Value×10, Seller×5, Currency×1, Average×1)
- Decision status mapping (0=rejected, 1=approved)
- Date/time partitioning for performance optimization

### 5. Data Quality and Governance

**Data Quality Guarantees**:
- Freshness: <1 second latency
- Completeness: 100% event capture
- Accuracy: Validated transformations
- Retention: 90 days with tiered storage

**Governance Framework**:
- Role-based access control
- PII protection and card data tokenization
- Audit trail for all data access
- Regulatory compliance alignment

## Analytical Capabilities

### Query Performance Optimization

**Partition Strategy**: Date-based partitioning for time-series queries
**Compression**: Dictionary encoding for categorical data
**Tiered Storage**: Hot (7 days) and cold (30 days) tiers

### Business Intelligence Support

**Real-time Dashboards**:
- Risk decision monitoring
- Fraud detection effectiveness
- Business impact assessment

**Historical Analysis**:
- Pattern recognition and trend analysis
- Regulatory reporting
- Model performance evaluation
